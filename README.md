# Temple VR
Build this at an internal Rehive hackathon with [networked-aframe](https://github.com/networked-aframe/networked-aframe#readme).

Multi player networking and voice chat is working. 

It takes really long to load all of the objects, nothing as been optimized.

## Local development
`npm run watch`
`npm run dev`

## Prod
`npm run start`

*Better to run with PM2 and nginx*
